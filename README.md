The Eclipse BaSyx DataBridge is part of the [Eclipse BaSyx middleware](https://www.eclipse.org/basyx/). It has been created within the [BaSys](https://www.basys40.de/) project.

The DataBridge can be used to integrate data sources within Asset Administration Shells.
It utilizes [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) to enable multiple datasources, transformers and the usage of the AAS as a datasink.

To learn more on how to use and adapt the DataBridge component, visit the [documentation](https://wiki.basyx.org/en/latest/content/user_documentation/basyx_components/databridge/index.html) in the BaSyx Wiki or take a look at the [Device Integration Example](https://wiki.basyx.org/en/latest/content/user_documentation/developer/basyx_java_v1/knowledge_base/scenarios/device-integration.html).
